# Plan: Task 3 - Create bin/run-installer Script

## Objective

Create a script that locates and runs the built installer package, making it easy to test installers after building.

## Implementation Steps

- [x] Step 1: Create `bin/run-installer` script
- [x] Step 2: Add logic to find installer in bundle directory
- [x] Step 3: Support multiple installer types (MSI, NSIS/EXE)
- [x] Step 4: Handle error case when no installer exists

## Script Design

Features implemented:
- `--msi` - Run MSI installer specifically
- `--nsis`/`--exe` - Run NSIS installer specifically
- `--build` - Build first if no installer found
- `--help` - Show usage information
- Auto-detect: prefers MSI if available, then NSIS
- Cross-platform launcher (start, xdg-open, open)

## Files Created

- `bin/run-installer` - Bash script to find and run installer

## Testing

- [x] Script finds MSI when it exists (auto-detect logic)
- [x] Script finds NSIS exe when MSI doesn't exist (auto-detect logic)
- [x] Script shows helpful error when no installer built
- [x] Script is executable
- [x] --help works correctly

## Risks/Considerations

- Bundle directory won't exist until first build-installer run - handled with helpful error message
- Multiple installer formats may exist - defaults to MSI, user can choose with flags
