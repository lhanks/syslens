# Task 3: Create bin/run-installer Script

**Status:** Completed
**Started:** 2026-01-11
**Completed:** 2026-01-11

## Description

Create a script `bin/run-installer` that runs the built installer (MSI/NSIS) after it has been built by `bin/build-installer`.

## Current State (Before)

- `bin/build-installer` exists and builds the installer package
- No script exists to easily run/launch the built installer
- User must manually navigate to bundle directory to find and run installer

## Changes Made (After)

Created `bin/run-installer` script with features:
- Auto-detects installer in bundle directory (prefers MSI over NSIS)
- `--msi` flag to specifically run MSI installer
- `--nsis`/`--exe` flag to specifically run NSIS installer
- `--build` flag to build installer first if not found
- `--help` flag for usage information
- Proper error messages when no installer is found
- Cross-platform support (Windows start, Linux xdg-open, macOS open)

## Notes

- Follows same patterns as other bin/ scripts
- Uses cygpath for Windows path conversion
- Tested help and error handling
