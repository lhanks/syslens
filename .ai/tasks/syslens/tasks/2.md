# Task 2: Add System Report Export Feature

**Status:** Completed
**Started:** 2026-01-11
**Completed:** 2026-01-11

## Description

Add ability to export out a complete system report to a file. This should allow users to save all collected system information (CPU, memory, disk, network, hardware) to a file for sharing or archiving purposes.

## Current State (Before)

- No export functionality existed
- System data was collected by various commands but couldn't be exported
- No native file save dialog integration

## Changes Made (After)

### Backend (Rust)
- Added `tauri-plugin-dialog` dependency for native save dialogs
- Created `SystemReport` struct aggregating all static system information
- Implemented `generate_system_report` command collecting:
  - Device, BIOS, Boot, OS, Uptime, Domain, User info
  - CPU, Memory, GPU, Motherboard info
  - USB devices, Audio devices, Monitors
  - Physical disks, Volumes
  - Network adapters
  - Services summary
- Added "Export System Report..." menu item (Ctrl+E)
- Wired menu event to frontend via `menu:export-report` event

### Frontend (Angular)
- Installed `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog` and `@tauri-apps/plugin-fs`
- Added `SystemReport` TypeScript interface
- Implemented export functionality in `SystemService`:
  - `generateSystemReport()` - calls backend command
  - `exportSystemReport()` - handles save dialog and file writing
  - Auto-generates filename: `syslens-report-{computer}-{timestamp}.json`
- Added export state management in `MenuService`:
  - `isExporting` signal for loading state
  - `lastExportResult` signal for success/error feedback
  - Menu event listener for Ctrl+E / File > Export

### Files Modified
- `projects/backend/Cargo.toml`
- `projects/backend/src/main.rs`
- `projects/backend/src/models/system.rs`
- `projects/backend/src/commands/system.rs`
- `projects/ui/src/app/core/models/system.model.ts`
- `projects/ui/src/app/core/services/system.service.ts`
- `projects/ui/src/app/core/services/menu.service.ts`

## Notes

- Export format is JSON for easy parsing and sharing
- Excludes dynamic data (processes, real-time metrics) - focuses on static config
- Services included as summary counts rather than full list
- Build verified with `cargo check`
