# Work Log: Task 1 - Fix UI Layout Issues

## Session: 2026-01-11

**Status:** Completed

### Progress

- Started investigation of UI layout issues
- Created task files
- Reviewed `dock-container.component.ts` - the CSS Grid layout component
- Used `git diff` to identify recent changes
- Found root cause: `overflow: hidden` was added to `.dock-main` div
- This blocked scrolling in the main content area
- Fixed by changing `overflow: hidden` to `overflow: auto` in both:
  - Inline style on line 40
  - CSS styles on line 134
- Task complete

### Root Cause

Recent changes added `overflow: hidden` to the dock-main container, which prevented the child `<main class="overflow-auto">` from scrolling. The fix changes this to `overflow: auto` to allow scrolling.

### Files Modified

- `projects/ui/src/app/shared/components/dock/dock-container.component.ts`
